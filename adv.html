  <h2> synopsis
    here are some of the notes that i have take from whatching gameplay.
*senu's perception tree is massive
*horse is essential for long distant missions
*Lyscndra oracle's side mission
*second story mission=lvl 5
*can see enemy heathbar
    -AI for nonplayable humans+animals so they could have thier own agendas
    -like in the first assassins creed the horse says put but in origins the horse can move around on its own
    -devs studied tech doc.from NASA or airborn particles impact or lighting e.g. sediments in water
    -cleo's rise to throne in 49 BCE Ptolemy the 13th the last medjay after he left
    -Giza,Memphis,Cyrene,Alexardia
